Class; CS 342, Assignment: Hw 4 - Group Project (ExamGrader).

SUMMARY:
This is a group project I have implemented ExamGrader.java which is the main program.

This program consists of main class called ExamGrader, this will read the file input and grade the exams from the file. Two or at least one file needed as an command lin argument. 

I have included this makefile and README file along with additional files, which probably not required this is just for testing purpose, such as exam-file.txt, savedExam.txt, saveAnswerFile.txt. 

Each class has private and public parts to it. Private part is kept secrete and cannot be accessed by the user. Public class can be accessed by the users.

Each class has constructor, which initializes the variables, if the class does not have a constructor, then a default constructor is allocated.

Each class has methods like setters and getters, as an example in Answer.java, I have a set method called setSelected, which sets the value boolean value for the selected answer, this does not return any value. There is also a gettor method called getValue, which returns the number of points that this answer contributes to the exam score, based on whether it is selected and its value when it is selected.

Dynamic memory allocation was allocated, such as for array in MCQuesion class, the array answerArray is extended by accessing member of structure by implementing .size. This will accomodate the desired data used.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM IN LINUX OR BASH:

To compile this using a makefile, change directory to the file location of the program, then by entering the word make at the linux or bert command, this program will compile, and then program is ready to execute. To execute this program after compiling, type java ExamGrader filename1.txt filename2.txt. You have to enter file name/s along with the ExamGrader, because this takes 1 or 2 files as an argument. I have used our class example files as an argument by entering at command line as follows 
"ExamGrader savedExam.txt saveAnswerFile.txt" or you can input 1 file as an argument also. If you enter more then 2 or less than 1 file as an argument then program will give error message, and also if the name of the file in the argument is mis-spelled then also the program will give an error message. After entering the proper command at command line, since this is a group project, my part of the program will print the name of the student followed by the time stamp and reports the grade. 

RUNNING THE PROGRAM ON IDE OR WINDOWS DOS:
In order to run this program on IDE or windows DOS, go to the file location prompt, at the prompt enter javac ExamGrader.java, this will progress to new command line, at this prompt enter Java ExamGrader along with aforesaid arguments, this will execute the program resulting in the aforesaid result.

OUTPUT:

This is a group project, my part of the program executes and the output is that, it prints student name, prints time stamp, and the 
prints the graded score.
